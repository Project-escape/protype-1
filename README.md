In the above screenshot 

A new folder "Game" is created and this repo is cloned there with folder name "protype-1". Don't mind the ".import" folder in the screenshot, as it is a runtime generated file.
create a folder called "assests" in the "protype-1" folder and paste all the assests in the zip file I emailed you there.

refer the below screenshot for assests structure.
